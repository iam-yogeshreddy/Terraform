Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used to define and provision infrastructure resources. The Terraform state file is a crucial component of Terraform that helps it keep track of the resources it manages and their current state. This file, often named terraform.tfstate, is a JSON or HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) formatted file that contains important information about the infrastructure's current state, such as resource attributes, dependencies, and metadata.
